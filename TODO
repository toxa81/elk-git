* clean SHT part
* test screened/unscreened U
* scalapack diagonalization
* regression tests
* cleanup gndstate
* [?] more compact representation for wave-functions
* parallelize matrix elements over G, not over interband transitions
* symmetry: lattice+magnetic

* the main Elk code is diverging; at least, merge the k-point generation
* [?] split source to levels (like in blas): basic subroutines, generic lapw subroutiens, main elk subroutines

* name change (in my code) for what is "forward" and "backward" spherical harmonic transform
* rho may have tiny negative values (like -10^-16); not good for xc potentials
* lmaxapw in response
